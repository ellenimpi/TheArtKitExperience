# TheArtKitExperience
A website and android app made for StarterHacks. Used openCV and Augmented Reality.

The purpose of this app is to increase Art awareness and to expand the art community. The project allows users to submit their own artwork to be displayed on the ArtKit website as well as via a projector at a physical location.

Firebase was used on a Bootstrap based website to display these images.

In order to access the website, go into the starterhacksite folder and run the "index.html" file.
